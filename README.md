# javaFullStack_Managment_Jsp
**Project Description:**
The project involves a basic Java full-stack application where a Management Person can send requests or reports to two departments: the Legal Department and the Finance Department. These departments receive the requests and respond with either approval or denial. The responses from the departments are then updated on the Management site.

**Key Components:**

1. **Management Portal:**
   - The Management Portal serves as the central interface where the Management Person initiates requests or submits reports.
   - It allows the Management Person to view the status of their requests and reports.
   - The portal should provide options to create new requests or reports and display the responses received from the Legal and Finance Departments.

2. **Legal Department Interface:**
   - The Legal Department Interface allows legal personnel to view incoming requests or reports from the Management Person.
   - Legal personnel can review the requests or reports and provide responses indicating approval or denial.
   - The interface should allow legal personnel to submit their responses back to the Management Portal.

3. **Finance Department Interface:**
   - Similar to the Legal Department Interface, the Finance Department Interface enables finance personnel to receive requests or reports from the Management Person.
   - Finance personnel can review and respond to the requests or reports with approval or denial.
   - The interface should facilitate the submission of responses back to the Management Portal.

4. **Integration:**
   - The system should integrate the Management Portal with the interfaces of the Legal and Finance Departments to facilitate seamless communication.
   - Updates from the Legal and Finance Departments should be reflected in real-time on the Management Portal.

**Functionality:**

1. **Management Portal Functionality:**
   - Allows Management Person to create new requests or reports.
   - Displays the status of requests and reports, including responses from the Legal and Finance Departments.
   - Provides options to view details of each request or report.

2. **Legal and Finance Department Functionality:**
   - Receive incoming requests or reports from the Management Portal.
   - Review the content of requests or reports.
   - Provide responses indicating approval or denial.
   - Submit responses back to the Management Portal.

**Technologies:**
- Backend: Java with Servlets for request handling.
- Frontend: JSP for user interface development.
- Database: MySQL for storing request details and responses.
- Communication: HTTP for communication between different components.
- Security: Implement basic authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the portal and department interfaces.

**Deliverables:**
- Complete source code of the application, organized into packages and classes.
- Database schema design and SQL scripts for setting up the necessary tables.
- Detailed documentation covering system architecture, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Include information on how to interact with the Management Portal and department interfaces.

**Project Flow:**
1. Management Person logs into the Management Portal.
2. They create a new request or submit a report.
3. The request/report is sent to the Legal and Finance Departments.
4. Legal and finance personnel review and respond to the request/report.
5. The responses are updated in real-time on the Management Portal.
